This python script can extract an image file from a visual basic `.frx` file.  The command-line prompts will ask for the file path to the `.frx` file, and then for the offset for the image (that can be obtained from the corresponding `.frm` file).
The offset can be entered in decimal format or as hexadecimal - if hexadecimal, use the prefix `0x` before the number (e.g., "0x0000").
